# 🚀 End-to-End AI & Machine Learning Product Engineering
### Transitioning from Service-Mindset to Product-Mindset

**Author:** Girish Adusumalli  
**Curriculum:** Krish Naik - Complete Data Science, ML, NLP & MLOps Bootcamp  
**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 | Conda | VS Code | Git | MLOps

---

## 🎯 The Mission
Most developers stop at "Code that works." My goal is to build **"Code that scales."** This repository is a live documentation of my journey from the fundamentals of Python to deploying production-grade AI models using MLOps.

## 🏗️ Repository Architecture
Each folder is structured as an independent module with its own documentation and environment requirements.

- `01_Python_Basics/` -> Core Syntax, Semantics, and Memory Management
- `02_Data_Structures/` -> Inbuilt Structures & Memory Optimization
- `03_Statistics_Math/` -> Probablity, Inferential Stats & Hypothesis Testing
- `04_Machine_Learning/` -> Feature Engineering to Gradient Boosting
- `05_Deep_Learning/` -> ANN, CNN, RNN, and Transformers
- `06_MLOps_Deployment/` -> AWS, Azure, Docker, and CI/CD Pipelines

## 🛠️ My Professional Setup
To ensure reproducibility (Industry Standard), I use isolated environments for every project:

```bash
# Environment Creation
conda create -p venv python=3.12 -y

# Kernel Connection (For Jupyter in VS Code)
pip install ipykernel

# Dependency Management
pip freeze > requirements.txt
