# 🧠 Module 2: Python Control Flow

Mastering the logic behind how programs make decisions and repeat actions. This module moves from static scripts to dynamic, interactive applications.

## 🚀 Key Learning Milestones

### 1. Conditional Logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Decision Trees:** Implemented nested conditions to handle complex real-world logic.
- **Practical Applications:**
    - **Leap Year Validator:** Used nested logic to determine calendar accuracy.
    - **Ticket Pricing Engine:** Created a multi-tier pricing system based on age and student status.
    - **Employee Bonus System:** Engineered a performance-based calculator using service years and ratings.
    - **Security:** Built a User Login System to validate credentials against stored data.

### 2. Iteration & Loops (`for`, `while`)
- **Range & Strings:** Mastered iterating over numerical ranges and character sequences.
- **Loop Control:**
    - `break`: Prematurely exiting a loop when a target is met.
    - `continue`: Skipping specific iterations (e.g., printing only odd numbers).
    - `pass`: Null operations used as placeholders for future logic.
- **Complex Automation:**
    - **Sum of N Numbers:** Mathematical automation using both loop types.
    - **Prime Number Generator:** Combined loops and conditional logic to find primes between 1-100.

## 💡 Industry Perspective: The "Product" View
In production environments, **Control Flow** is where efficiency is won or lost.
- **Scalability:** Poorly designed nested loops (O(n²)) can crash a server as data grows.
- **Safety:** Proper `if-else` validation prevents unauthorized access (Login Systems) or financial errors (Bonus Calculators).
