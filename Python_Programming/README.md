# 🐍 Module 01: Complete Python Programming

This folder contains my end-to-end journey in mastering Python for AI and Data Science. I am following the Krish Naik bootcamp to build a solid foundation in software engineering and product development. 🇮🇳

## 🎯 My Mission
To shift from a **Service-Based Mindset** to a **Product-Based Mindset**. Every line of code in this folder is written with scalability, memory efficiency, and clean architecture in mind.

## 🛠️ My Engineering Standards
1. **Isolated Environments:** Every script runs in a dedicated `conda -p venv`.
2. **Reproducibility:** Dependencies are locked via `requirements.txt`.
3. **Clean Code:** Strictly following PEP 8 standards (snake_case, modularity).
